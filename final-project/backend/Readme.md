## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your environment and start the server:

    ```
    xcode-select --install
    ```
2. Install MariaDB:
    ```
    brew install mariadb
    ```
3. Install OpenSSL (required for some Python packages):
    ```
    brew install openssl
    export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include"
    ```
4. Install MySQL client library:
    ```
    pip install mysqlclient
    ```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**
